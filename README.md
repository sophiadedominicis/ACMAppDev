ACM Club app dev team - Schedule Generator
==========================================

About
-----
This project was started as part of The University of Richmond ACM Club for the application development team.

What It Is
-----------
Our app accepts as many courses as a student may want to take along with all the offered sections of each course.  Then, with
our algorithm, generates all possible non-conflicting schedules.

Where It Is
-----------
Right now the PHP version is available at http://mikedombrowski.com/sched/.
We are currently still developing the Java version which will then be used to make the Android version.

Theory of Operation
--------------------
Our algorithm is essentially a recursive tree, which is explained more in the image below.
